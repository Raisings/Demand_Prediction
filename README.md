# Demand_Prediction

This is a project to study the demand for a product that varies with the change in its price with Machine Learning.

## DataSet
The dataset contains:
1. the product id;
2. store id;
3. total price at which the product was sold;
4. base price at which the product was sold;
5. Units sold (quantity demanded);

## Major Steps 

- study the dataset
- check if the dataset has any null values
- remove the row that has a null value
- use a scatter plot to analyze the relationship between the price and the demand for the product
- use a heatmap to study the correlation between the features of the dataset
- Training a machine learning model to predict the demand for the product at different prices

## Conclusion
This is how to train a machine learning model for the task of product demand prediction using Python. Price is one of the major factors that affect the demand for the product. If a product is not a necessity, only a few people buy the product even if the price increases.
